# Hyper-EMG
Hyper EMG Fitting algorithm and error analysis

Enclosed are two python scripts and their documentation; 'Hyper-EMG' annd 'Find Fit Uncertinty'.

The 'Hyper-EMG' script is used to determin a Exponential Modefied Gaussian model for a given data set.
Instructions for it's proper use can be found within the 'User Manual' PDF

The 'Find Fit Uncertinty' script is used in succession with the model fitting function. It's perpose is to determin the peak shape,
and statistical uncertainties associated with a given Hyper EMG fit.

Information regarding the Hyper-EMG method can be found in the paper titled:
"Hyper-EMG: A new probability distrinution function composed of Expoentially Modefied Gaussian distributions to analyze asymmetric pwak shapes in high-resolution time-of-flight mass spetrometry"


Information about the uncertainty calculation methods used within the 'Find Fit Uncertainty' script can be easly found on page 10, 
under the 'Uncertainty contributions' section within the paper titled:
"High-resolution, accurate multiple-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometry for short-lived, exotic
nuclei of a few events in their ground and low-lying isomeric states"
